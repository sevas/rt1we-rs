Raytracer in one weekend, in rust.

https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/

This is a toy project for educational purpose. 
Don't expect anything mindblowing. Just simple code from first principles. 

## python tools

- `scripts/ppm2png.py`: convert a folder of ppm files to png
- `scripts/imview.py`: [pyqtgraph](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based viewer for image files. Image will be updated every time the file is changed.
